I learned how issues, branches, and pull requests connect in a real workflow using git and integrating in Github.
Some mistakes I made was that I used ">" instead of ">>" which overwrote README so I had to redo README. I also tried adding before creating a file a couple times.
The lifesaver command was "echo" as it made creating a file with text and appending to it easier from the terminal.
